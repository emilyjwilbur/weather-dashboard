## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## The Process
- Referred to the mock clip to get an understanding of the weather dashboard and it's content and functions
- rewatched class video from monday morning for help on the api call using fetch
- googled trying to UV Index. Couldn't figure it out. Very challenging.
- googled converting date to unix. Still couldn't figure it out. 
- simply didn't have time or energy with the project starting today as well.
- never got to local storage or second api call to get 5 day or UV index
